# Description
This program is a practice of mysql and its relation  to javascript  and npm packages by creating  an employee management app. It was certainly a challenging, but rewarding process. Some details still need to be ironed out, but at the point of writing this I can safely say that it is both functional and effective! 
## Instructions
